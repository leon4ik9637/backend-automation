    RestAssured - it is a library we can do our automation

    With the help of Jackson library we can do:
    Serialization - Converting Java object to JSON object
    De-serialization - Converting JSON object to Java object


   With the help of ObjectMapper class coming from Jackson libraries,
   we can do serialization and de-serialization

   POJO
   It helps us to manipulate the attribute and
   provides re-usability
