    Why do we do Performance Testing?
    - To make sure that our application is working under certain conditions.

    Performance Test Types:
    Load -> Checking the expected load of the application
    Stress -> Objective of the stress testing is to find test breaking point
    Spike -> How our application will behave in case the test group will be increased
    Endurance -> It is long testing, around three hours. Checking the memory leak issues.
    And checking how our application is behaving
